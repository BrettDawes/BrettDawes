- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrettDawes
- 👀 I’m a Talent Partner with Sanity.io, an opensource CMS with real-time collaboration tools and a hosted backend that can do wonders with structured content!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic HTML, CSS, JQuery/JS so that I can hopefuly construct a page or two someday
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any Front end Engineers with a JavaScript/React skillset who are keen to develop an opensource CMS toolkit
